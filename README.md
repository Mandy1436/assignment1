Module2 : Basic Python Concepts

#1 ---- in task 1.
Input Section:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
First, it displays "Enter the first number: " and waits for the user to input a value.
Then, it displays "Enter the second number: " and waits for another input.
Data Conversion:
The inputs (initially strings) are converted to integers using int() to allow numerical operations.
Arithmetic Operations:
The program performs the following calculations using the two numbers:
Addition: Adds num1 and num2 (num1 + num2).
Subtraction: Subtracts num2 from num1 (num1 - num2).
Multiplication: Multiplies num1 and num2 (num1 * num2).
Division: Divides num1 by num2 (num1 / num2). Note: If num2 is 0, this will cause a runtime error (division by zero).

Output Results:
Each result is printed to the console with a descriptive label:
"addition: " followed by the sum.
"subtraction: " followed by the difference.
"multiplication: " followed by the product.
"division: " followed by the quotient.

Program Termination:
After displaying all results, the program ends.


Task 2:
Input Section:
The program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name.
First, it displays "Enter your first name: " and waits for the user to input a value.
Then, it displays "Enter your last name: " and waits for another input.

Data Handling:
The inputs are automatically treated as strings (text) by input().

String Concatenation (Display):

The program combines the first name (first_name), last name (last_name), and a welcome message into a single string for output.

Output Result:
The full greeting is printed to the console in the format:
"Hello, [first_name] [last_name] ! Welcome to the python program".

Termination:
After displaying the greeting, the program ends.
